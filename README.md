stripe-ctf-2.0
==============

My solutions to Stripe CTF, web edition.

I participated in the contest in August 2012 and successfully solved all 9 levels
(was [#133](https://stripe-ctf.com/leaderboard/6 "Stripe CTF Leaderboard") 
to capture the flag).

These are my solutions to each level. They're not the best solutions, but they worked.

Status: no solutions have been added yet. Working on polishing them slightly.
