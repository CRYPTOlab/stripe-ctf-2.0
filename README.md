stripe-ctf-2.0
==============

My solutions to Stripe CTF, web edition.

I participated in the contest in August 2012 and successfully solved all 9 levels
(was [#133](https://stripe-ctf.com/leaderboard/6 "Stripe CTF Leaderboard") 
to capture the flag).

These are my solutions to each level, along with a short writeup explaining them. They're not the best solutions, but they worked.

Status: added solution ideas for all levels and full solutions for levels 0-3.
